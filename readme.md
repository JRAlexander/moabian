Project Moab is an open source ball balancing robot built to demonstrate the end-to-end Microsoft Project Bonsai Platform, a low-code AI platform for building autonomous systems.

If you have the hardware kit, you can find all the setup documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/moabian/wiki).

For a high level overview of the hardware and Tutorials of how to train a brain to balance a ball on Moab, visit the [Project Moab Website](https://microsoft.github.io/moab/).
